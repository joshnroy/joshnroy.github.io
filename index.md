My goal is to create robust, helpful, and trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can aid and collaborate with humans. My interests include _Reinforcement Learning (RL)_, _state representation_, and _uncertainty quantification_. Through these methods, I believe that we can create AI agents that are able to represent and reason about the world like humans, enabling them to be trusted to make decisions. My application areas of interest include _Robotics_ and _Healthcare_.
