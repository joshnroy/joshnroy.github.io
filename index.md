I am a founding engineer at a [full-stack AI](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs#full-stack-ai) startup called [Pillar Advisors](https://www.pillar-advisors.com/) working on LLM, agentic, and machine learning-enabled automation within professional services including Tax and Accounting.

Previously, I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer on topics ranging from large scale machine learning and production pipelines in systematic trading at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/),  deep learning/computer vision applications at [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/), and reinforcement learning and robotics research during my internship at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), undergrad, master's.

I have also been a researcher at [MLCollective](http://mlcollective.org/), a non-profit machine learning research lab.

I graduated my Master's in Computer Science at Brown University, supervised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), and [James Tompkin](http://jamestompkin.com/), in May 2020. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Brown University as well as intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) and [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/).

My goal is to research, develop, and create embodied Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning algorithms and systems. My interests include (but are not limited to) **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Planning/Reasoning**, and **Generative/World Modeling**, with applications to real-world domains such as **Robotics**, **Finance**, and **Healthcare**.

I've just started writing about my thoughts. Check out my [blog](/blog/).

Outside of Computer Science, I do things like teaching [Taekwondo at Columbia](https://www.instagram.com/cutaekwondo/) and rock climbing.
