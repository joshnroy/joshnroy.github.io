I am a Software Engineer at [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/), working on deep learning/computer vision applications in factory automation.

I just graduated my Master's in Computer Science at Brown University, working with [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), and [James Tompkin](http://jamestompkin.com/), in May 2020. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Brown.

My goal is to create robust, general, and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI). My interests include **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Learning Representations & Priors**, and **Uncertainty Quantification**, with applications to **Robots**, and other autonomous agents.

## Current Projects

**Generalization in Reinforcement Learning using Metric Learning and Uncertainty Quantification**
<br>
  Current Deep Reinforcement Learning agents overfit to training levels and cannot solve unseen levels of the same task. We aim to learn state abstractions that overcome the generalization gap by learning latent-space metrics and quantifying agent uncertainty. Collaboration with researcher at McGill.
**Learning Representations from Naturalistic Object Transformations in Video**
<br>
  Contrastive algorithms have been shown to improve generalization and unsupervised learning by learning invariances to specific image transformations. We apply contrastive learning using sequential (rather than i.i.d.) video frames and learn invariances to real-world transformations, resulting in general object representations. Collaboration with researcher at MIT & UC Berkeley.
