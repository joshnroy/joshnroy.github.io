I am a founding engineer at a [full-stack AI](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs#full-stack-ai) startup called [Pillar Advisors](https://www.pillar-advisors.com/) working on LLM and machine learning-enabled automation within financial domans including Tax and Accounting.

Previously, I have worked as a Machine Learning and Backend Engineer on topics ranging from modeling pipelines and data analysis in systematic trading at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/),  deep learning/computer vision applications at [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/), and machine learning/artificial intelligence research during my internship at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), undergrad, master's.

I have also been a researcher at [MLCollective](http://mlcollective.org/), a (very cool!) non-profit machine learning research lab.

I graduated my Master's in Computer Science at Brown University, working with [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), and [James Tompkin](http://jamestompkin.com/), in May 2020. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Brown University as well as intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) and [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/).

My goal is to create robust, general, Artificial Intelligence (AI). My interests include (but are by no means limited to) **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **LLM Agent-Based Approaches**, and **Distributed Systems**, with applications to real-world domains such as **Automation**, **Finance**, and **Healthcare**, **Music**, **Art**, and **Lifestyle**.

Outside of Computer Science, I do things like teaching [Taekwondo at Columbia](https://www.instagram.com/cutaekwondo/), photography, rock climbing, and music.
