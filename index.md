I am a founding engineer at a [full-stack AI](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs#full-stack-ai) startup called [Bridger](https://www.bridgergp.com) working on LLM, agentic, and machine learning-enabled automation within professional services including Tax and Accounting.

Previously, I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer on topics ranging from large scale machine learning and model-based planning in systematic trading at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/),  deep learning/computer vision, and reinforcemment learning from human feedback (RLHF) at [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/), and academic research in reinforcement learning and robotics during my internship at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), undergrad, master's at [Brown University](http://bigai.cs.brown.edu).

I have also been an independent researcher at [MLCollective](http://mlcollective.org/), a non-profit machine learning research lab.

I graduated my Master's in Computer Science at Brown University, supervised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), and [James Tompkin](http://jamestompkin.com/), in May 2020. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Brown University.

My goal is to research, develop, and create embodied Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning algorithms and systems. My interests include (but are not limited to) **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Planning/Reasoning/World Modeling**, and **Abstraction/Representation for State/Action/Reward**, with applications to real-world domains such as **Robotics** and **Finance**.
