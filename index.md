I am passionate about using technology to change the world! And about technology as a whole. My goal is to create robust, safe, and beneficial Artificial Intelligence and my interests span the power set of research, machine learning, quantitative technologies, and anything futuristic (ex: AR/VR, automation, robotics).

I have been very fortunate to work at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) and [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/) focusing on research, development, and productization of machine learning across industries such as quantitative finance and factory automation. Prior to that, I completed my Master's and Bachelor's in Computer Science at Brown University where I had the opportunity to research machine learning/robotics as well as intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) and [Cognex](https://www.cognex.com/).

In my free time, I do things like teaching [Taekwondo at Columbia](https://www.instagram.com/cutaekwondo/), [photography](https://www.instagram.com/thosehippos/), rock climbing, and music.
