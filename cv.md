## Selected Projects

**Generalization in Reinforcement Learning using Metric Learning and Uncertainty Quantification**
<br>
  Current Deep Reinforcement Learning agents overfit to training levels and cannot robustly solve unseen levels of the same task. We learn state abstractions that overcome the generalization gap by learning latent-space metrics and quantifying agent uncertainty. Current project with researcher at McGill & Facebook AI Research.

**Learning Representations from Naturalistic Object Transformations in Video**
<br>
  Contrastive algorithms are used for unsupervised learning and improve generalization by learning invariances to specific image transformations present in training data. We apply contrastive learning to sequential (rather than i.i.d.) video frames and learn invariances to naturally occuring transformations, resulting in general object representations. Current project with researcher at MIT & UC Berkeley.

**Multi-Recursion Neural RSA**
<br>
  The Rational Speech Acts (RSA) posit that humans act as rational probabilistic speakers and listeners, engaging in recursive reasoning in order to make inferences about the intent and pragmatic meaning behind utterances. We implemented RSA as a neural network and measured the change in accuracy as a function of recursion depth. Project completed at Brown University in 2020.
