## Quick Take

We created an accessible drone platform that democratizes robotics education by using commodity hardware (Raspberry Pi) and Python, making it affordable for educational institutions worldwide. This work challenged the assumption that meaningful robotics education required expensive equipment, proving that a sub-$300 platform could teach fundamental concepts from control theory to computer vision.
