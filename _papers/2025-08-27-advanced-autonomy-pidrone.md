## Quick Take

Building on the original PiDrone work, this paper demonstrated that sophisticated autonomous behaviors could be achieved on low-cost hardware, making advanced robotics education more accessible. We showed that a sub-$300 platform could perform SLAM, autonomous navigation, and multi-robot coordination - capabilities typically reserved for platforms costing 10x more.
